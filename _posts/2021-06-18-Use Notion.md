I've been a long user of Evernote until I came across to Notion in 2020. Only about a decade ago, the cloud-based service that can be access from multiple devices (e.g. iPhone 3G) was a new thing. Auto-synchronization, how cool was that when it first came out. Notion on the other hand has the features that are beyond the cloud based memo service. Here are some of the good to knows before using the new, Silicon-Valley hot application: 

- The best part of notion is that it is a tool you can utilize for multi-purpose: memo, documentation, idea sketch, organization, project, database, and beyond. Unlimited and free for all unless the file you attach is more than 5MB. It is a text editor of its own, so it has the standard format in styling which allows you to focus more on the contents.
    - Focus for the contents writings rather than styling
    - Unlimited potential for cutomization
    - Easy to share through creating a web page
- You can think of each new page as a folder in a file system. It is possible to create a page within a page within a page or even drag and drop to a different page. This way of information organization gives you an easy access to replicate what you have in mind to actual pages of different depth.
- Page can be consist of entities, which is called a 'bock'. These blocks may include text, to do list, date, table, board, gallery, calendar, etc. Clicking :: button will give you the wide variety of options to choose from

- Each page you create can be shared with others as a URL web page or sleek-looking PDFs. It can also be exported as a markdown format which can be easily integrated to different usage e.g. Github page

One example that I have used within SDG AI Lab is for the recruitment process. Through the tool, it was easy to:

- Create a table with multiple columns and turn a column into a checkbox
- Create a sub-page under each candidate to organize CV & application package and write memo during an interview
- Publish to web to share the progress with other colleagues
